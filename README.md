Gained 0.5 units of BMI and lowered body fat percentage by 2% from ~20% to ~18% in the span of 7 months.  
Was previously underweight years ago, gained significant amount of fat during the CoVid-19 pandemic period hence an increase in BMI.  
Started incorporating cardio on weekly workouts around January 2024. Expecting a significant amount of decrease in body fat percentage in a few months.

Weight and Lean Mass trendline at roughly the same slope angle, which indicates an almost steady amount of body fat mass during an increase in lean and overall mass.  
To lower body fat percentage, I could:  
- increase lean mass while maintaining fat mass or
- decrease fat mass  
Since my goal is to reach 60-65kg @ 15% body fat, the best approach is the former.  
That's about 51-55kg of lean mass, 5 more additional kgs from the current.  
From July to late November (~4.5 months): gained ~2kg lean mass.  
From late November to End of December (1 month): gained ~1kg lean mass.  
The difference is I took protein supplements starting November.
It greatly increased the speed of lean muscle mass (from ~0.5kg to ~1kg increase per month).
So a consistent supplementation and meeting of daily protein requirement will lead me to my goal in about 5 months, hopefully by July 2024.

Neck and Hip circumferences not changing much. Waist circumference changed significantly (~5%). May indicate that I store majority of my body fat in my belly.
